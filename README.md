# Student Write-up Final Project
*Note*: I modified the evaluation.py file so that it maximizes frame size of plots on Windows (this was working only under Ubuntu).
  
## Tracking
We can see in the picture below the RMSE results.
  
I calculated the 3D versions of the F and Q matrix, as they were not provided in the project outline.

## Track Management
The track was eventually deleted, although as mentionned in the project rubric, it takes a long time.
  Below the RMSE plot.

## Data Association
Several ghost tracks are detected but none is ever confirmed. Real tracks are never lost.
  Below the RMSE plot.

## Sensor Fusion
Using the camera allows to slightly reduce the RMSE, but the impact is really slight (about a few centimeters).

# Student Write-up Mid-Term Project
I will present the different parts of the implemented project here.

## Compute Lidar Point-Cloud from Range Image
### S1
#### EX1
Here is an example of stacked image I obtained by executing my code.  
Images were resized within the main loop as their witdh was too big for manual analysis.
![Stacked Image](/img/range_image.JPG)

### Step 1
#### EX2
Below can be found 3 examples of pointclouds:
![PCL 1](/img/pcl_1st.png)
  
![PCL 2](/img/pcl_2nd.png)
  
![PCL 3](/img/pcl_3rd.png)
  
I added purple rectangles to identify different vehicles.  
After going through a serie of pointcloud, I would say following features appear to be stable:
  * front-bumper and rear-bumper: that's the feature which is always there even in worst cases, we can intuitively recognize a car
  * wheels: when a bit more points are available, we can recognize the car wheels
  * Generally speaking, every metallic part of the car is a good reflector. Which makes sense. Below another picture to illustrate this:  
![PCL 4](/img/pcl_4th.png)

### Step 2
In the exercise 2 i create the BEV view. I followed instructions provided in the lesson rather than in the code, as there is a mistake in the comments. The provided code suggests to take the intensity of the highest point in a cell, instead of taking the point with most intensity in the cell.
I used the percentile function in order to normalize intensity.
Below an example of obtained BEV:  
![BEV](/img/bev_example.JPG)


### Step 3
I met following difficulties:
 * The conversion of coordinates for the bounding box. It took me some time to realise the x and y axes were switched.
 * The structure of "detections" variable provided by the fpn_resnet took me some time to understand before being able to re-use it. In the end, as we only detect vehicles in this exercise, we do not need to extract the class id.

Here is an example of result:  
![FPN Detection](/img/fpn_resnet_detection.JPG)  
We can see that 2 vehicles out of 3 are correctly detected.

### Step 4
#### EX1
For this part, i used the shape library to compute the ious.
I didn't know how to handle the corner case where the algorithm would draw several times a bounding box for the same object. I decided to count them as independant detections. Meaning that if a real object was detected twice, this means I have 2 true positives.

#### EX2
The number of false_negatives is equal to the number of times I was not able to match a label to at least one detection.
The number of false_positives is equal to the number of times I detected an object minus the number of true positives.

#### EX3
In order to check my results, I ran the full project only using the result files. Then I used my version of "measure_detection_performance" and reach the same results. I did this operation because my numbers were not matching to the one provided in the exercises.

When executing my own code on the whole chain I find nearly the same numbers versus the analysis of numbers provided from the results files.
Here are my results using the parameters provided for the exercise:  
  * precision = 0.9611307420494699
  * recall = 0.8888888888888888  
![Overall Results](img/overall_results.png)  

The error alonz z axis is extremely high. But this is because the Step 4 is executed using Darknet. And according to the provided code, when using darknet model, Z takes the arbitrary value of 0. So this makes no sense to check this value.  


# SDCND : Sensor Fusion and Tracking
This is the project for the second course in the  [Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213) : Sensor Fusion and Tracking. 

In this project, you'll fuse measurements from LiDAR and camera and track vehicles over time. You will be using real-world data from the Waymo Open Dataset, detect objects in 3D point clouds and apply an extended Kalman filter for sensor fusion and tracking.

<img src="img/img_title_1.jpeg"/>

The project consists of two major parts: 
1. **Object detection**: In this part, a deep-learning approach is used to detect vehicles in LiDAR data based on a birds-eye view perspective of the 3D point-cloud. Also, a series of performance measures is used to evaluate the performance of the detection approach. 
2. **Object tracking** : In this part, an extended Kalman filter is used to track vehicles over time, based on the lidar detections fused with camera detections. Data association and track management are implemented as well.

The following diagram contains an outline of the data flow and of the individual steps that make up the algorithm. 

<img src="img/img_title_2_new.png"/>

Also, the project code contains various tasks, which are detailed step-by-step in the code. More information on the algorithm and on the tasks can be found in the Udacity classroom.

## Installation Instructions for Running Locally
### Cloning the Project
In order to create a local copy of the project, please click on "Code" and then "Download ZIP". Alternatively, you may of-course use GitHub Desktop or Git Bash for this purpose. 

### Python
The project has been written using Python 3.7. Please make sure that your local installation is equal or above this version. 

### Package Requirements
All dependencies required for the project have been listed in the file `requirements.txt`. You may either install them one-by-one using pip or you can use the following command to install them all at once: 
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` 

### Waymo Open Dataset Reader
The Waymo Open Dataset Reader is a very convenient toolbox that allows you to access sequences from the Waymo Open Dataset without the need of installing all of the heavy-weight dependencies that come along with the official toolbox. The installation instructions can be found in `tools/waymo_reader/README.md`. 

### Waymo Open Dataset Files
This project makes use of three different sequences to illustrate the concepts of object detection and tracking. These are: 
- Sequence 1 : `training_segment-1005081002024129653_5313_150_5333_150_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`
- Sequence 2 : `training_segment-10072231702153043603_5725_000_5745_000_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`
- Sequence 3 : `training_segment-10963653239323173269_1924_000_1944_000_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`

To download these files, you will have to register with Waymo Open Dataset first: [Open Dataset â€“ Waymo](https://waymo.com/open/terms), if you have not already, making sure to note "Udacity" as your institution.

Once you have done so, please [click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/waymo_open_dataset_v_1_2_0_individual_files) to access the Google Cloud Container that holds all the sequences. Once you have been cleared for access by Waymo (which might take up to 48 hours), you can download the individual sequences. 

The sequences listed above can be found in the folder "training". Please download them and put the `tfrecord`-files into the `dataset` folder of this project.


### Pre-Trained Models
The object detection methods used in this project use pre-trained models which have been provided by the original authors. They can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pqx7sShlqKSGmvshTYbNDcUEYyZwfn3A/view?usp=sharing) (darknet) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RcEfUIF1pzDZco8PJkZ10OL-wLL2usEj/view?usp=sharing) (fpn_resnet). Once downloaded, please copy the model files into the paths `/tools/objdet_models/darknet/pretrained` and `/tools/objdet_models/fpn_resnet/pretrained` respectively.

### Using Pre-Computed Results

In the main file `loop_over_dataset.py`, you can choose which steps of the algorithm should be executed. If you want to call a specific function, you simply need to add the corresponding string literal to one of the following lists: 

- `exec_data` : controls the execution of steps related to sensor data. 
  - `pcl_from_rangeimage` transforms the Waymo Open Data range image into a 3D point-cloud
  - `load_image` returns the image of the front camera

- `exec_detection` : controls which steps of model-based 3D object detection are performed
  - `bev_from_pcl` transforms the point-cloud into a fixed-size birds-eye view perspective
  - `detect_objects` executes the actual detection and returns a set of objects (only vehicles) 
  - `validate_object_labels` decides which ground-truth labels should be considered (e.g. based on difficulty or visibility)
  - `measure_detection_performance` contains methods to evaluate detection performance for a single frame

In case you do not include a specific step into the list, pre-computed binary files will be loaded instead. This enables you to run the algorithm and look at the results even without having implemented anything yet. The pre-computed results for the mid-term project need to be loaded using [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-s46dKSrtx8rrNwnObGbly2nO3i4D7r7?usp=sharing) link. Please use the folder `darknet` first. Unzip the file within and put its content into the folder `results`.

- `exec_tracking` : controls the execution of the object tracking algorithm

- `exec_visualization` : controls the visualization of results
  - `show_range_image` displays two LiDAR range image channels (range and intensity)
  - `show_labels_in_image` projects ground-truth boxes into the front camera image
  - `show_objects_and_labels_in_bev` projects detected objects and label boxes into the birds-eye view
  - `show_objects_in_bev_labels_in_camera` displays a stacked view with labels inside the camera image on top and the birds-eye view with detected objects on the bottom
  - `show_tracks` displays the tracking results
  - `show_detection_performance` displays the performance evaluation based on all detected 
  - `make_tracking_movie` renders an output movie of the object tracking results

Even without solving any of the tasks, the project code can be executed. 

The final project uses pre-computed lidar detections in order for all students to have the same input data. If you use the workspace, the data is prepared there already. Otherwise, [download the pre-computed lidar detections](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IkqFGYTF6Fh_d8J3UjQOSNJ2V42UDZpO?usp=sharing) (~1 GB), unzip them and put them in the folder `results`.
